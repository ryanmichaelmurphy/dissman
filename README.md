# Dissman "Artist" Statement
I have made 5 children's books, and Dissman is the most childish project I have allowed into the world. It is mostly a reflection of technical skills and interests build up over time, an attempt to put some thoughts and goals together in a single package. However, insulting can be an art, and the challenge here is to find an algorithmic way to generate good insults. Not necessarily a good insult every time, but generate insults in bulk to stumble into something both humorous and devastating.

There are 2 main parts of Dissman. One is a traditional algorithm; the other uses Open AI's Dall-E 2 API. The "insult generator" portion of the project is built from code I wrote trying to teach myself string (word) manipulation for the first time as a completely inexperienced teacher of high school computer science. The underlying logic is simple: take a list of insulting adjectives and list of insulting nouns, choose one from each list at random, and put them together. I find myself always making note of creative, funny insults, and they usually follow the pattern of using an [adjective][noun] combination in a way I would have never expected. Dissman gets to a similar result through sheer volume.

The Open AI portion is even simplier in what it asks of me as a programmer. While the underlying technology is complex, Dissman just takes whatever Dall-E gives. I intented to use generative AI with a user picture and a prompt based on the chosen insult to put them in a setting or to modify their appearance inspired by the insult. I tested Dall-E 2, the only version of Open AIs image generator that allows you to submit a picture, with an image of myself, and the output was just a worse version of myself. It was like a picture of my worst fear: myself at my office cubical, aging, and ugly. It was hilarious that this was the sophisicated tool that they had made available -- a way to make yourself look worse -- and ultimately, in my code, Dissman just sends a picture to Dall-E 2 and shows what comes back.

My interest in text generation started as a kid. I read an article about an early verison of Beck's website that had a Beck lyrics generator. It was hilarious because it was both ridiculous and effective. Beck's lyrics often seem like word salad, and the results felt like conceivable Beck lines. My first text generation projects were attempts to recreate this program for any artist, and when it was easier to scrape the internet for lyrics, they kind of worked too. Like the kind of poetry where you black out lines in the newspaper, there were interesting ideas to discover.

My interest in AI generally, and text generation neural networks in particular, started when this AI generated obituary made the rounds on the internet.

Like _Total Recall_, it's wonderful because it is terrible, but it also hits some beautiful, artistic notes. "She owed us so many poems." It also manages to scrape some truth. "In lieu of flowers, send Brenda more life." Isn't that what Brenda would really prefer?

What really captured me is the non-linear construction of ideas. My mind usually goes from A-to-B. This bot goes from A-to-7. It's absurd, but it's connected enough to not be completely random. I thought, "Can I get computers to compensate and do my non-linear thinking for me?" Some other projects on my github ([Lyrics Generator](https://github.com/ryanmichaelmurphy/Lyrics_Generation_With_TextGenRNN/blob/main/Lyrics%20Generator.ipynb), [Music Bot](https://github.com/ryanmichaelmurphy/Music-Bot-3000)) are reflections of these attempts in writing lyrics and music. The results are worse then Brenda's obituary, but sometimes, the output just as fun and interesting. There are seashells in the wrack, and I've enjoyed combing through for them and putting them in a basket in my beach house bathroom. I also felt extremely empowered in being able to build on the code and libraries built by others to achieve my own ends. I wrote code that used a neural network! What the does that mean? I don't know, but it sounds very cool. These projects inspired more personal technical development that has served me well.

While I still have plenty of unrealized ideas for the software, the case really had no vision behind it until the very end. I was talking with Allen about not have a physical conception of Dissman, and he said, "I think it's a really juvenile idea... and I mean that in the best possible way." He pitched Dissman a middle school bully, and that conception made sense and got me rolling. My wife, Grace, picked out the toaster oven head and helped me choose the source material for the case, a baby's tactile toy. That allowed me to go beyond juvenile to infanile, and Dissman is now realized as his pointless atomic age robot toy self.   

## An open letter to myself/project post mortem

If I'm being honest with myself, I problably only created this "artist" statement to codify my thoughts on the project and hope that someone else would read my ideas on process. I spent way more time than I expected on this project. I experienced a lot more frustration and far less joy than I expected. When this kind of thing happens, I compensate for lost time and frustration in evaluating where things went wrong and would could be done better in future projects. 

But before I get into the issues, I want to list the positive takeaways. They are not insignificant, and it's easy to lose sight of them when you are frustrated.
1. I exhibited the self-discipline to sit down and put hours into a project.
- Just doing the work is really the biggest impediment to achieving most goals. I'm proud of myself that I made myself use my time after my daughter went to bed and on the weekends to make something. It has been a while since I took on a larger project that wasn't for work or a Mardi Gras costume. I'm glad I started pushing myself back to doing this, and after investing all this time in a project I wouldn't have chosen if I knew how long I'd work on it, I have the opportunity to reflect on how I want to use this rediscovered ability and where I want to invest myself.  
2. I finished, albeit late.
- This wasn't a given. It felt like one step forward, two steps back at many points in this very dumb project, and there were many moments where I questioned whether I should continue throwing good time after bad. I gave in to the sunk cost fallacy, and I got the project over the finish line.
3. I enjoyed physically manipulating things.
- This is a particularly important point when you spend you day working in technology, and you are evaluating what you want to do next.

There were two main areas of the project where I struggled:
1) creating the user interface
2) getting the hardware to interact with the software correctly

In light of these struggles, I have some new lessons for myself:
1. If you are having to learn how to use a new tool to get the job done, learn the tool you really want to learn how to use.
  - I created Dissman in Python, and I realized pretty quickly that I would need a more robust user interface than the library that I was using initially, tkinker. ChatGPT recommended another Python library, kivy, for the interface. However, despite having a fair amount of Python experience, learning the new library was challenging, and I'm still not sure that I fully get it. In retrospect, I wish I had invested the time into learning a more powerful and flexible tool that I would probably want to use in future projects, Unity. While I'm talking about Python libraries, I suspect this lesson applies to analog tools as well; don't cut metal with a Dremel when you want to get better at using a plasma cutter, etc.  
2. ChatGPT can tell you how to do it, but you still should decide whether you should do it.
  - ChatGPT is a tool. It's a tool I use at work daily, and it has allowed me, an amateur programmer, to complete tasks well beyond my ability. I think it may be the beginnings of the greatest tool humans have ever made, but right now, it is still a tool that requires your direction. Like anything with computers, it will only do what you tell it to do. When you ask it how to do something, it will tell you how to do it, but it will not tell you that there is a better way to do the thing you want to do. You must maintain the broader perspective on general approaches to a goal or a problem. You can ask it what the possible approaches are and the pros and cons of various approaches are.  
3. When using new hardware, start with a tutorial that uses that exact hardware.
4) Personal projects are like professional projects in scope. Think about how long you really think it will take, and then multiply that by 3 or 4. That's the good estimate.
5) Take the Home Depot approach and buy more hardware than you need. Don't get held up by lack of hardware or broken hardware. Buy more than one of everything with the expectations that you will have to make returns.
6) Always be very thoughtful in where and how you invest your time.
- Evaluating how you would feel putting yourself out there in certain ways. Mission creep. If it's harder than you expect, would you still do it?
